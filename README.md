# Lab Handbooks
A list of lab handbooks<sup>*</sup> (documents that communicate lab group ethos, expectations, policies, and procedures to group members) available openly on the internet.
Largely inspired by a [Mastodon thread](https://fosstodon.org/deck/@elduvelle@neuromatch.social/112876144574596149) with some of my own additions.


<sup>*</sup> "Handbook" is not always the term used, but I feel like it is the least ambiguous of the ones I've encountered.
I've also seen these called lab manuals, lab policies, and lab guides.
